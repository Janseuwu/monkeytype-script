# monkeytype-script
im not gonna make a proper readme i really dont care

## Installation
clone repo with `git clone` <br>
cd into it of course and run the program with `python3 main.py` <br>
you might need to install `requirements.txt` and change the program so it runs on your system

## Features
- its just cheats for monkeytype.com
- you can make it type a specified WPM (it sucks though and is very inconsistent)

## TODO
- maybe make it not suck
